                        <p>Hi, it’s me the one and only Bea in your life! I know it's kinda weird why I do this but yk me I like doing things for you.</p>
                        <p>I know for a fact that if you’re reading this right now, it means we’re on a call and I’m seeing you, so look at the camera and say hi to me first, hehe. Anyway, you’re probably wondering why I made this, mhmm? Well, I was just waiting for the perfect little moment to do all of this. And just like what we said the other day if you like someone, why not just go for it? It shouldn’t be put off any longer, right? And I believe everything has its perfect timing, so I guess this is it. This is the time.</p>
                        <p>First of all, I just want to say that I’m really thankful to have you in my life. Just like you said you didn’t expect the plot twist of your life, especially now in 2025 and honestly, I feel the same. Falling in love with an amazing woman wasn’t on my bingo card, but hey here I am, loving you in the most genuine way I possibly can.</p>
                        <p>I actually don’t really know where to start, so just imagine me right now, assessing and sorting all my thoughts, trying to put this together in the most organized way possible haha. Anyway, I know I haven’t said this to you until now, but I’m super interested in you. Every little thing I learn about you makes me fall even harder. It’s like knowing you more never makes me love you any less. I’m amazed by how sentimental and appreciative you are, you always notice and value even the little things people do for you. You carry wit in your words and compassion in your heart, a beautiful mix that I genuinely admire about you every single day. I remember when we were at the Airbnb, you said that I’m just infatuated that that’s why I do all these things. But no. Infatuation, for me is just an intense feeling for another person, fantasy, where you’re in love with the idea of them, not with who they truly are. And that’s far from what I’m feeling towards you. The emotional connection, the warmth, the safety, it’s all there. It’s not just about feelings it’s also about the sense of commitment I feel towards you. I always care about you, even when it’s not easy. And I know myself well enough to say that I can be honest with you about what I’m thinking when it comes to our relationship.</p>
                        <p>For now, what I know is I really love you. I never expected myself to be this committed to anyone, but here I am. I want you to feel safe, valued, and loved by me. I know you’re scared, and I wish I could just pull those thoughts out of your head and show you how safe you are with me, baby. You’re not a burden for feeling this way, it’s valid, and I’m not going anywhere just because things get a little hard. You don’t have to fight your thoughts alone. Let me be your safe space when your mind isn’t. I love you for who you are not for anything that came before, or might come after.</p>
                        <p>Even when your thoughts try to push me away, I’ll keep holding your hand gently until your heart feels safe again.</p>
                        <p>I don’t know what tomorrow holds, but if it has your hand in mine, I know it’s worth it. You're worth it, my jane.</p>
                        <p>Now, I only have one question for you and it’s right there when you click the button.
By this time, I don’t think you can see me on the camera anymore, cos right now while I’m making this i'm shaking (like u do the other night haha). But we’ll see. I want you to answer it on the call, okay? Before you click the option you’ll see in there. I love you, baby!</p>
